        <p>
          The International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres is a non-profit
          organisation founded in 1957 by Swami Vishnudevananda and named in
          honour of his teacher H.H. Sri Swami Sivananda Saraswati Maharaj, one
          of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century.
          The Organisation propagates the authentic teaching of yoga and
          vedanta, continuing the lineage of the two great yoga masters,
          preserving its purity and tradition dating back several thousand
          years. Their message that the individual must change before the world
          can change is at the core of all yoga. We are a centre for spiritual
          growth and learning, with many thousands of yoga teachers worldwide
          trained since 1963. The mission is to spread the teachings of
          classical yoga, integrating the Four Paths of Yoga through the Five
          Points of Yoga of Swami Vishnudevananda into a means to achieve
          physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing, and self-realisation. We
          uphold the practice of all aspects of the classical teachings of a
          synthesis of yoga with a strong emphasis on practical experience.
          Swami Sivananda’s dictum ‘an ounce of practice is worth tons of
          theory’ is strictly followed. Many of the teachers dedicate their
          lives to the study and practise of yoga, living within the
          Organisation as renunciants or swamis.
